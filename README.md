My ST build.

Patches includes...
- [Alpha](https://st.suckless.org/patches/alpha/) Terminal Transparency
- [Font2](https://st.suckless.org/patches/font2/) Allows a secondary font for extra glyphs.
- [Scrollback](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/) Allows scrollback through the terminal
- [Bold is not bright](https://st.suckless.org/patches/bold-is-not-bright/) In st, bold text is rendered with a bold font in the bright variant of the current color. This patch makes bold text rendered simply as bold, leaving the color unaffected.
- [Boxdraw](https://st.suckless.org/patches/boxdraw/) Custom rendering of lines/blocks/braille characters for gapless alignment.
- [Clipboard](https://st.suckless.org/patches/clipboard/) Allows clipboard from terminal to browser.
- [Dynamic Cursor Color](https://st.suckless.org/patches/dynamic-cursor-color/) Swaps the colors of your cursor and the character you're currently on (much like alacritty).
- [Open Copied URL](https://st.suckless.org/patches/open_copied_url/) Open contents of the clipboard in a user-defined browser.
- [Xresources](https://st.suckless.org/patches/xresources/) This patch adds the ability to configure st via Xresources. At startup, st will read and apply the resources named in the resources[] array in config.h.
